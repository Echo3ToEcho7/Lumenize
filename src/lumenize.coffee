## Installation and developing ##

To install in the node_modules directory of your project, run the following from the root folder of your project:

`npm install Lumenize`
    
To install globally:

`sudo npm install -g Lumenize`
    
Or if you want the latest from source, download/clone from GitHub and run:

`cake install`
    
If you want to add functionality to Lumenize and submit a pull request, add tests for your upgrades and make sure all test pass with:

`cake test`
    
Also, add examples in the "docstrings", then generate the docs (which will also confirm that the examples give the expected output when run):

`cake docs`
